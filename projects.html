          <h2>Untitled sock project</h1>
          <p>
            The goal of the installation is to create a beautiful sock-shaped knit-piece through a cooperative blowing process. The construction can be manned by as many as 3 participants at a time. Each of these users can blow on a pressure sensor through a colored straw that is presented to the players at face-level.
